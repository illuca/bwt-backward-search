As of May 2009, according to IDC data, Intel was responsible for more than three-quarters of all processors sold worldwide. The company has recognized, however, that most consumers cant make much headway trying to weigh their processors against each other based on their naming conventions. Research has shown that a few brand names stick out, such as Intel and Pentium, but beyond that, most consumers have given up trying to decipher processor names and technologies, especially for laptops. And yet, when they walk into a big-box retailer, theyre faced with endless stickers on a variety of notebooks, describing cryptic processor choices, which can be overwhelming. In an effort to simplify its naming structure and clarify where its chips lie on a spectrum, Intel launched its mobile Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 processor families in late 2009 and early 2010. According to Intel, these families correspond to "good," "better," and "best," respectively. That approach sounds simple enough, until you start to wonder what happens to the processors already on the marketand the ones to come. Intel tells us the plan is (though the company stopped short of making promises) that what is Core i7 today will not turn into Core i5 tomorrow. In other words, changes wont have a waterfall effect, and we shouldnt expect a Core i9 to appear and the Core i3 to disappear. Instead, the plan is to keep these three families under these names, and when the company launches newer/faster/better processors, it will do so across all three lines (relatively) simultaneously. What will define each family will be its features more than its speeds. In time, it is possible that new Core i5 processors will gain some of the features that existed in only Core i7s before. But we shouldnt see individual processors cascading down the chain. "Based on past sales cycles, we believe the Core brand may comprise up to half of the Intel-based PCs on retail shelves by the second half of the year," says Brian Fravel, director of brand strategy at Intel. This begs two questions, then: What happens to the processors that came before, and what do you need to know about them? Well, for starters, the most popular mobile chips circa the end of 2009, the Core 2 family (which includes the Core 2 Duo and Core 2 Quad), will phase out and should be no longer for sale in new laptops by the end of the first quarter of 2010. And then theres Centrino and Centrino 2, two more Intel brands youll often see when shopping for laptops. Neither is a processor line, but instead a platform, or self-contained ecosystem. Each consists of not just a particular CPU, but also the chipset, wireless network circuitry, and other technologies to increase battery life and performance. The Centrino brand is specific to laptops. The Intel Centrino name has evolved away from a brand for PCs to the new name for Intels WiFi and WiMAX wireless technologies in the laptops design, providing better performance and broader wireless network interoperability. Nonetheless, it has been so popular (and widely advertised) in the past few years that its worth explaining again now, since used and refurbished systems with Centrino branding are sure to be available for years to come. In addition to Centrino, you may also hear about Turbo Memory, which was introduced with Centrino 2 during the Santa Rosa launch. Turbo Memory decreases bootup and application launch times. We should also note that if you do find yourself considering a notebook with Centrino 2 technology, you should feel comfortable buying it. Centrino 2-designated laptops were top-of-the-line until this Core launch, and laptops with Centrino 2 characteristics still offer among the best in wireless connectivity, performance, and battery life. The fact that Intel is phasing out the brand does not mean the laptops based on it have become obsoletenor that the company is doing away with all the technology inside. While were relatively pleased with these changes, we were a little disappointed that the Intel laptop-CPU scheme wont be quite as simple as "good," "better," and "best." Thats because Intel is also keeping the Pentium brand around as a classic processor for the budget-conscious and the Celeron brand for entry-level consumers on extremely tight budgets. Not that these are such bad processors, but it muddies the clear structure Intel is going for. And, by the way, thats not to mention Intels Atom processor line for netbooks (low-powered mini-notebooks), which is also sticking around for the long-term. Atom processors are at the bottom of the laptop-CPU food chain and reserved for 11.6-inch or smaller notebooks that generally cost less than $500.[22]128MB RDRAM[23]40GB Ultra ATA Hard Drive (7200RPM)[24]Pentium III[25]Dell Dimension 8100 Series[26]Dell's NEWDimension featuresthe IntelPentium 4Processor!

Thats a lot of potential buyers who already have a nice slate to curl up with. And the market is simply maturing. Depending on your perspective, tablets may seem like a new thing, but think about it: Its coming on five full years, early 2010, since the introduction of the first iPad. Its been a long half-decade since then of Apple rolling out ever-thinner, ever-better iPads. At the same time, a whole parallel industry of Android and Windows 8 tablets, big and small, has grown up around it. In short, the tablet market has splintered and widened, and many buyers now own a tablet or three. Many folks not inclined to even touch a computer have been given them as gifts; maybe an e-reader, too. The pace of upgrades and adoption has slowed as the pool of first-time buyers shrinks. And as tablets get better and better, shoppers are inclined to buy new ones even less often. A bit of an exaggeration, but the upgrade cycle is expanding from a bicycle wheel to a Ferris wheel. In a sense, the iPads may also be a case of making something so well that you dont need to replace it all that often (example: the early light bulb), a quaint idea in this era of planned and unplanned obsolescence. An original 2010 iPad may be chunky, unsexy, and a bit sluggish by todays standards, but if the battery still holds a charge, its still viable for basic use, video playback, and Web browsing. And an iPad Air or fourth-generation iPad still has plenty of fire left in it. Indeed, the iPad Air 2 does a smooth baton hand-off from the 2013 Airthe baton trailing a ribbon that says Best Tablet You Can Buy. The hardware remains among the slickest in the business (though it got its biggest challenge this year in the form of Samsungs stunning Galaxy Tab S models). But its the Apple ecosystem that puts the iPad over the top again and again, and it does it again in the iPad Air 2. The hardware remains best in class, or close to it, but its the sheer volume of iPad-optimized apps, and the iPads central importance among app developers, that makes the iPad Airssimply puttodays default tablets. Okay, first there's the hardware. Eventually, the iPad will reach a point where its physically impossible to get the tablet any slimmer without some fundamental compromises or materials-science breakthroughs. Its clear were getting close. Though Apple managed to get the tablet marginally thinner, the weight is essentially the same as before. Its a fraction of an ounce below the 1-pound-even of the 2013 iPad Air, so even a postal scale probably wont register the difference. However, the Air 2 does feel perceptibly skinnier in your hand, thanks to its planed-down profile. Indeed, perhaps its too light, in a sense. This is a somewhat fragile device, yet it feels wisp-like in hand, almost too easy to grasp casually and then drop. (Who would have thought that something this big being this light might be a problem?) You definitely want to outfit this tablet with a protective case at time of purchase. It looks just stunning whether you opt for the tablet in silver, space grey, or gold. (We tested the grey.) The grey version is the only one now with a black front bezel; the silver and gold versions have a white face. This feature debuted on the iPhone, and it was widely assumed it would show up on the iPad before long. Well, here it is: Now, you can lock the iPad Air 2 and authenticate entry via a finger-swipe on the button. From all reports, and in our experience here, it works as well on the Air 2 as it does on the iPhones. You can also use Touch ID to authenticate Web-site and payment logins, freeing you from password-poking hell when browsing or buying, This is all handled via the Touch ID & Passcode submenu in the Settings menu.[56]Around the edges, there have been some changes. Apple removed the traditional iPad slider-switch at upper right that was previously used for either muting/unmuting the audio or locking the orientation. (Youd choose one of the two functions for the slider to serve in the tablets settings.) Now, mute is relegated to pushing the volume all the way down, and orientation lock is handled strictly via iOS, via the Control Center (the mini-menu you reach by swiping up from the bottom of the screen). We rather miss the physical orientation-lock function; the swipe-and-touch process to activate the lock, though it's hardly arduous, now means we're less inclined to use it. As before, the audio output is clear and precise, but not room-filling. It's perfectly adequate for single-user movie watching or music listening, so long as you don't prop up the tablet on your lap in portrait orientation, in which case you'll muffle the speakers. Of course, the make-or-break design feature of any tablet is the display, and in the case of the iPad Air 2, its screen is easily up to the standard of its predecessors with Retina screens. The Retina screen in the full-size iPads is a 9.7-inch display with a resolution thats slightly higher than full HD; well talk more about it on the next page. (Apples smaller iPad Mini comes in two versionsthe iPad Mini 2 and Mini 3that also use a Retina-variety screen as their 7.9-inch displays.) But its integrated as well as ever, with a new antiglare coating thats markedly more effective at reducing reflections than the original iPad Airs surface is (though it's not wholly effective). Part of the reason thats possible is an internal change to the way the screen is made. We mentioned the new barometer a moment ago; that was put in place to measure altitude, including for health-related applications that may involve, say, climbing stairs. That sensor complements the accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS, also present in previous iPads. (Note that "true" GPS functionality is only provided in the cellular-capable iPad Air 2 models; the mapping function in the Wi-Fi only models uses Wi-Fi triangulation.) The Wi-Fi connectivity, which will be the connection type that most users will lean on most of the time, is leading-edge 802.11ac, the latest multi-band connection that works over a 5GHz connection. To get the most out of it, you will need an 802.11ac-compliant router that supports MIMO, though of course the iPads Wi-Fi chip will bounce down in speed to accommodate older access points. And as ever, for those who need their iPads to be connected at all times, Apple also offers each color and capacity variant of the iPad Air 2 in a cellular-capable version for an extra $130. Here, though, theres a new twist: The iPad Air 2 makes use of a multi-carrier mini-SIM card (dubbed "Apple SIM") that allows buyers to shift among, at least in the United States, three carriers: bwt-Mobile, AT&bwt, and Sprint. (Verizon still requires its own.) That will allow for easier switching between carriers, if you opt for a pay-as-you-go plan, want a short-term plan rather than a contracted monthly commitment, or change locations. Beyond the carrier-switching ability, the iPad Air 2 also brings new support for 20 LTE bands, which, depending on your carriers plan and local conditions, can allow for up to 150Mbps downloads via the cellular connection. (We did not have the opportunity to test this.) This is a change-up versus the previous iPad storage hierarchy, which went up in steps of 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB. The 32GB step was eliminated with the iPhone 6 family, and that carried over to these latest iPads, as well. Ourselves, we'd like to see the entry step boosted to 32GB, and the 16GB eliminated, seeing as the iPad still lacks a wish-list feature asked for since the first model in 2010: a flash-card slot. cTable'mon, Apple![57]999[58]5[59]$2.99[60]$0.10[61]Haliburton, Ontario CA[62]Nov 25 18:09 PST[63]Nov 27 18:09 PST[64]45416810[65]Auction does not get automatically extended.* Seller will ship internationally.[66]boy1der_1998[67]5[68]Accepts Yahoo!
